# Security mindset

The ability to evaluate risk and constantly seek out and identify the potential or actual breach of a system, application, or data

## Data and asset classification

**Asset classification** means labeling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization
- The classification of an organization's assets ranges from low to high level

### Classifying for safety

- Public data
  - Does no need extra protection, already accessible to the public and poses a minimal risk to the organization if viewed or shared by others
  - still needs to be protected from security attacks
- Private data
  - Information that should be kept from the public
  - If an individual gains unauthorized access, potential to pose a serious risk to an organization
  - Includes company email addesses, employee identification numbers, and an organization's research data
- Sensitive data
  - Must be protected from anyone who does not have authorized access
  - Unauthorized access can cause significant damage to an organization's finances and reputation
  - Includes PII, SPII, and PHI
- Confidential data
  - Often has limits on the number of people who have access to it
  - Access to confidential data sometimes involves the signing of non-disclosure agreement (NDAs)
  - Includes trade secret, financial records, and sensitive government data

### Identify and protect

Creating business continuity and disaster recovery plans are the final steps of a four-part process that most security teams go through to help ensure the security of an organization

1. Identify the assets that must be protected in the organization
2. Determine what potential threats could negatively impact those assets
3. After the threats have been determined, implement tools and processes to detect potential threats to assets
4. Create the business continuity and disaster recovery plan
