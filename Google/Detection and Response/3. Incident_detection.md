# Incident detection

## Incident response lifecycle

1. Preparation
2. **Detection & Analysis**
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
4. Post-incident Activity

### Detection & Analysis

- Where incident response teams verify and analyze incidents
- *Detection*: The prompt discovery of security events
  - Tools liike IDS and SIEM collect and analyze event data from different sources
  - If an incident is detected, an alert is sent out to security teams to analyze
- *Analysis*: The investigation and valudation of alerts
  - Analysts must apply their ciritical thinking and incident analysis skills to investigate and validate alerts

#### Methods

- Threat hunting
  - Proactive search  for threats on a network
  - Security professionals use threat hunting to uncover malicious activity that was not identified by detection tools and as a way to do further analysis on detections
  - Also used to detect threats before they cause damage
- Threat intelligence
  - Evidence-based threat information that provides context about existing or emerging threats
  - Can come from private or public sources
    - Industry reports
      - Often include details about attacker's TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)
    - Government advisories
      - Similar to industry reports, government advisories include details about attackers' TTP
    - Threat data feeds
      - Provide a stream of threat-related data that can be used to help protect against sophisticated attackers like APT (Advanced Persistent Threats)
        - *APT*s are instances when a threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time
- Cyber deception
  - Involves techniques that deliberately deceive malicious actors with the goal of increasing detection and improving defensive strategies
  - *Honeypots* are an examples of an active cyber defense mechanism that uses deception technology
    - *Honeypots*: systems or resources that are created as decoys vulnerable to attacks with the purpose of attracting potential intruders
- Crowdsourcing
  - Practice of gathering information using public input and collaboration

### Indicators of Compromise (IoC)

- Indicators of compromise (IoC)
  - Observable evidence that suggests signs of a potential security incident
  - *Who* and *What*
- Indicators of attack (IoA)
  - Series of observed events that indicate a real-time incident
  - Focus on identifying the behavioral evidence of an attacker
  - *Why* and *How*

#### Pyramid of pain

Captures the relationship between indicators of compromise and the level of difficulty that malicious actors experience when indicators of compromises are blocked by security teams

1. Hash values
  - Hashes that correspond to known malicious files
  - Often used to provide unique references to specific samples of malware or files involved in an intrusion
2. IP address
3. Domain names
4. Network artifacts
  - Observable evidence created by malicious actors on a network
5. Host artifacts
  - Observable evidence created by malicious actors on a host
6. Tools
  - Software that's used by a malicious actor to achieve their goal
7. TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Proceduress)
  - The behavior of a malicious actor
  - Tactic: refers to the high-level overview of the behavior
  - Techniques: provide detailed descriptions of the behavior relating to the tactic
  - Procedure: highly detailed descriptions of the technique

## Documentation

Any form of recorded content that is used for a specific purpose, and it is essential in the field of security

### Benefits

- Transparency
  - Critical for demonstrating compliance with regulations and internal processes, meeting insurance requirements, and legal proceedings
- Standardization
  - Standardization through repeatable processes and procedures supports continuous improvement efforts, helps with knowledge transfer, and facilitates the onboarding of new team members
  - **Standards** are references that inform how to set policies
- Clarity
  - Clear documentation helps people quickly access the information they need so they can take necessary action

### Best practices

- Know yout audience
- Be concise
- Update regularly

### Chain of custody

The process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle
- Establish proof of the integrity, reliability, and accuracy of the evidence
- As soon as evidence gets collected, chain of custody forms are introduced
  - The forms should be filled out with details as the evidence is handled

### Playbooks

Manual that provides details about any operational action
- Provides security analysts with instructions on exactly what to do when an incident occurs

#### Types

- Non-automated
  - Requires step-by-step actions performed by an analyst
- Automated
  - Automate tasks in incident response processes
  - Tasks such as categorizing the severity of the incident or gathering evidence can be done using automated playbook
- Semi-automated
  - Combine a person's action with automation

## Response and Recovery

### Triage

The prioritizing of an incidents according to their level of importance or urgency

#### Process

1. Receive and assess
  - Is the alert a false positive?
  - Was the alert triggerd in the past?
  - Ist the alert triggered by a known vulnerability?
  - What is the severity of the alert?
2. Assign priority
  - Functional impact
    - Incidents that target information technology systems impact the service that these systems provide to its users
  - Information impact
    - Incident can affect the CIA of an organization's data and information
  - Recoverability
    - How an organization recovers from an incident depends on the size and scope of the incident and the amount of resources available
3. Collect and analyze

#### Benefits

- Resource management
  - Allows security teams to focus their resources on threats that require urgent attention
- Standardized approach
  - Process documentation help to move alerts through an iterative process to ensure that alerts are properly assessed and validated

## Incident response lifecycle

1. Preparation
2. Detection & Analysis
3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**
4. Post-incident Activity

### Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

**Containment** is act of limiting and preventing additional damage caused by an incident

**Eradication** involves the complete removal of the incident elements from all affected systems

**Recovery** is the process of returning affected systems back to normal operations

### BCP (Business continuity plan)

A document that outlines the procedures to sustain business operation during and after significant disruption
- helps organizations ensure that critical business functions can resume or can be quickly restored when an incident occurs

#### Site resilience

**Resilience** is the ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptions

- 3 types of recovery sites
  - Hot sites
    - Fully operational facility that is duplicate of an organization's primary environment
  - Warm sites
    - Facility that contains a fully updated and configured version of the hot site
    - Not fully operational and available for immediate use but can quickly be made operational
  - Cold site
    - Backup facility equipped with some of the necessary infrastructure required to operate
    - Might need additional work to be operational


## Incident response lifecycle

1. Preparation
2. Detection & Analysis
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
4. **Post-incident Activity**

### Post-incident activity

The process of reviewing an incident to identify areas for improvement during incident handling

- During this phase, different types of documentaion get updated or created
- *Final report* is documentation that provides a comprehensive review of an incident
  - Includes a timeline and details of all events related to the incident and recommendations for future prevention
  - Common elements:
    - Executive summary
      - A high-level summary of the report including the key findings and essential facts related to the incident
    - Timeline
      - A detailed chronological timeline of the incident that includes timestamps dating the sequence of events that led to the incident
    - Investigation
      - A compilation of the actions taken during the detection and analysis of the incident
    - Recommendations
      - A list of suggested actions for future prevention

- *Lessons learned meeting* includes all parties involved in the incident and generally held within two weeks after the incident
  - The incident is reviewed to determine what happened, what actions were taken, and how well the actions worked
  - The final report is also used as the main reference document
