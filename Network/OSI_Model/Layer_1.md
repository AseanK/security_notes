# Layer 1 - Physical Layer

Transport data using electrical, mechanical, or procedural interfaces\
Maintains the data rate\
Data are sent in **bits** using

- Electrical impulse
- Light
- Radio waves

## Topologies

### Point-to-Point Topology

- Simplest communication between two nodes

### Mesh Topology

- Each and every device has a dedicated point-to-point connection with each and every other device in the network

### Star Topology

- Devices have a dedicated point-to-point connection with a central controller or hub

### Bus Topology

- Multiple devices are connected through a single cable

### Ring Topology

- Each device is connected with repeaters in a circle

### Tree Topology

- Variation of the Star topology, has a hierarchical flow of data

## Cable types:

### UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair

- Commonly used to connect PCs or switches
- **RJ-45** connector type
- Maximum length of 100 meters

### Straight-Through

- Used to connect end devices such as PCs and routers to switches

### Crossover

- Used to connect devices directly, most often used to connect two of the same type of devices

### Fiber-optic Cables

- Carries light as a signal
- Faster than wire cables
- Supports longer distance and higher bandwidth
- Made up of a core, cladding, and a buffer
  - Core: The central part of the fiber where the light travels
  - Cladding: A material that surrounds the core and has a lower refractive index
  - Buffer: A material that surrounds the cladding and protects the fiber from damage.
- Single-mode
  - Supports longer distances (<500m) than multi-mode
  - Most Single-mode cables are colored yellow
- Multi-mode
  - Covers shorter distance (>500m) than single-mode
  - The larger core diameter in multimode fiber cables allows for a greater number of signals/ rays of light to travel through at a time
