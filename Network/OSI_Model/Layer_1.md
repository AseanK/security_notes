## Layer 1 - Physical Layer
Transport data using electrical, mechanical, or procedural interfaces\
Maintains the data rate\
Data are sent in bits using
- Electrical impulse
- Light
- Radio waves

### Topologies
- Point-to-Point Topology
  - Simplest communication between two nodes

- Mesh Topology
  - Each and every device has a dedicated point-to-point connection with each and every other device in the network

- Star Topology
  - Devices have a dedicated point-to-point connection with a central controller or hub

- Bus Topology
  - Multiple devices are connected through a single cable

- Ring Topology
  - Each device is connected with repeaters in a circle

- Tree Topology
  - Variation of the Star topology, has a hierarchical flow of data

### Cable types:
<b>UTP</b> - Unshielded Twisted Pair
- Commonly used to connect PCs or switches
- <b>RJ-45</b> connector type
- Maximum length of 100 meters

<b>Straight-Through</b>
- Used to connect end devices such as PCs and routers to switches

<b>Crossover</b>
- Used to connect devices directly, most often used to connect two of the same type of devices

<b>Fiber-optic Cables</b>
- Carries light as a signal
- Faster than wire cables
- Supports longer distance and higher bandwidth
- Made up of a core, cladding, and a buffer
  - Core: The central part of the fiber where the light travels
  - Cladding: A material that surrounds the core and has a lower refractive index
  - Buffer: A material that surrounds the cladding and protects the fiber from damage.
- Single-mode
  - Supports longer distances (<500m) than multi-mode
  - Most Single-mode cables are colored yellow
- Multi-mode
  - Covers shorter distance (>500m) than single-mode
  - The larger core diameter in multimode fiber cables allows for a greater number of signals/ rays of light to travel through at a time
